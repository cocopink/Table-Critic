critic_instruction = """You are an intelligent critic tasked with determining which step of the table reasoning is incorrect based on the following information:

1. Original Table: The raw table data.
2. Question: The question pertaining to the table data.
3. Reasoning Steps: A step-by-step process of sub-table transformations and extractions based on the following functions. 
    - f_add_column(): Adds a new column to the table.
    - f_select_row(): Selects specific rows based on the question.
    - f_select_column(): Removes irrelevant columns from the table.
    - f_group_column(): Groups rows based on the values in a specific column.
    - f_sort_column():  Sorts rows based on the values in a specified column.
4. Prediction Answer: Final derived answer following the reasoning chain.
5. Automated Verification Results (if provided): Deterministic checks on each reasoning step (e.g., row index bounds, column existence, sort order). Use these as hints to guide your analysis, but do not treat them as definitive — your own reasoning takes priority.

Instruction:
1. **Step-wise Analysis**: Conduct an evaluation of each reasoning step's validity. The step that is unnecessary but does not affect the answer is considered correct.
2. **Analysis Categories:**
    - For correct steps: Provide validation reasoning and mark as `Step <NUM> is correct.`.
    - For incorrect steps: Detail the logical flaws and mark as `Step <NUM> is incorrect.`.
    - You should stop at the first incorrect step.
3. **Conclude this critique**: Summarize this critique with an explicit conclusion.
4. **Conclusion Categories**:
    - Conclude with 'Conclusion: [Incorrect] Step <NUM>'.

4. Prediction Answer: The answer derived from the final sub-table.

Instruction: 
1. **Analysis**: Conduct an analysis of each reasoning step's validity. The step that is unnecessary but does not affect the answer is considered correct.

2. **Conclusion**:
    - If the Prediction Answer is incorrect, conclude with either 'Conclusion: [Incorrect] (ERROR ROUTE)' or 'Conclusion: [Incorrect] (random)'. 
    - Use '(ERROR ROUTE)' to indicate the specific path in the error tree that represents the error. 
    - If no such route can be identified, use '(random)' instead.
