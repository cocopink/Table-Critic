1. f_add_column(): Adds a new column to the table.
2. f_select_row(): Selects specific rows based on the question.
3. f_select_column(): Removes irrelevant columns from the table.
4. f_group_column(): Groups rows based on the values in a specific column.
5. f_sort_column():  Sorts rows based on the values in a specified column.

**Instructions*
I will use the functions defined above to process and manipulate the original table. Your task is to answer questions based on the extraction process and the resulting sub-table.
When answering:
- Provide an explanation first.
- If you have multiple answers, you can separate them with '|'.

cot_demo = """Example 1:
Question:
how many total points did the bombers score against the bc lions?
Extraction process:
f_select_row(row 5, row 9) -> f_select_column(opponent, score)
Resulting sub-table:
/*
col   : opponent  score
row 1 : vs. bc lions  29-16
row 2 : at bc lions  29-19
*/
Explanation: The Bombers scored 29 points in the first game and 29 points in the second game against the BC Lions. By adding these scores together, the total points scored by the Bombers against the BC Lions is 58.
Answer: 58

Example 2:
Question:
which elections reached over 39% of the popular vote?
Extraction process:
f_select_row(row 5, row 6, row 7) -> f_select_column(election, % of popular votes)
Resulting sub-table:
/*
col   : election | % of\npopular votes
row 1 : 2003     | 44.67               
row 2 : 2007     | 39.15               
row 3 : 2011     | 39.34               
*/
Explanation: The 2003 election had a popular vote percentage of 44.67%, which is above 39%. The 2007 election also exceeded 39% with a popular vote percentage of 39.15%. The 2011 election also had a percentage of 39.34%, which is slightly above 39%. Therefore, the 2003， 2007 and 2011 elections reached over 39% of the popular vote.
Answer: 2003|2007|2011

Example 3:
Question:
what is the average score of all home team members for all dates?
Extraction process:
f_add_column(home team score) -> f_select_column(home team score)
Resulting sub-table:
/*
col   :  home team score
row 1 :  4
row 2 :  2
row 3 :  1
row 4 :  1
row 5 :  2
row 6 :  3
row 7 :  1
row 8 :  0
*/
Explanation: The average score of all home team members for all dates can be calculated by adding all the scores together and dividing by the number of rows. The sum of all scores is 14 (4+2+1+1+2+3+1+0) and there are 8 rows. Therefore, the average score is 1.75.
Answer: 1.75

Example 4:
Question: 
when was the first year of rugby of the terrapins?
Extraction process:
f_select_row(row 2) -> f_select_column(nickname, rugby\nsince)
Resulting sub-table:
/*
col   : nickname   |  rugby\nsince

row 2 : 437
row 3 : 932

*/
Explanation: Based on the extracted sub-table, the attendance for the games was 847, 437, 932, 863, 456, and 971. All of these games had an attendance under 1000. Answer that 6 games had an attendance of less than 1000.
